# ADR-001: Serverless Architecture for Cloud Security Posture Management

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2025-07-29

**Deciders**: Cloud Remediator Sage Architecture Team

**Technical Story**: Foundation architectural decision for CSPM platform

## Context and Problem Statement

The Cloud Remediator Sage requires a scalable, cost-effective architecture to process security findings from multiple cloud scanners, perform risk analysis, and generate automated remediation scripts. The system must handle variable workloads, integrate with multiple cloud providers, and maintain high availability while minimizing operational overhead.

## Decision Drivers

* Variable workload patterns (batch processing security scans)
* Cost optimization for unpredictable usage patterns
* Integration with AWS services (Neptune, S3, CloudWatch)
* Rapid deployment and scaling requirements
* Minimal operational maintenance overhead
* Security and compliance requirements for CSPM systems

## Considered Options

1. **Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda + managed services)**
2. **Container-based microservices (ECS/EKS)**
3. **Traditional server-based architecture (EC2)**

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "**Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda + managed services)**", because it provides optimal cost efficiency for variable workloads, automatic scaling, reduced operational overhead, and seamless integration with AWS security services.

### Positive Consequences

* **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-per-execution model optimizes costs for batch processing
* **Automatic Scaling**: Handles variable security scan volumes without pre-provisioning
* **Reduced Operations**: Managed services eliminate server maintenance
* **Security**: Built-in security controls and compliance frameworks
* **Integration**: Native integration with AWS security and data services
* **Fast Development**: Accelerated development cycle with managed infrastructure

### Negative Consequences

* **Cold Start Latency**: Initial function invocation delays (mitigated with warming)
* **Execution Time Limits**: 15-minute Lambda timeout requires careful function design
* **Vendor Lock-in**: Strong coupling to AWS ecosystem
* **Complex Debugging**: Distributed system debugging complexity
* **State Management**: Stateless functions require external state storage

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Serverless Architecture (AWS Lambda + managed services)

Lambda functions for processing, Neptune for graph analysis, S3 for storage

* Good, because automatic scaling matches workload variability
* Good, because cost-effective for intermittent batch processing
* Good, because reduced operational overhead and maintenance
* Good, because native AWS security service integration
* Bad, because cold start latency impacts time-sensitive operations
* Bad, because vendor lock-in limits portability
* Bad, because execution time limits require function decomposition

### Container-based microservices (ECS/EKS)

Containerized services with orchestration for scaling and management

* Good, because consistent runtime environment across development and production
* Good, because better control over resource allocation and performance
* Good, because easier local development and testing
* Good, because portable across cloud providers
* Bad, because higher operational overhead for cluster management
* Bad, because constant resource costs even during idle periods
* Bad, because more complex CI/CD pipeline setup and maintenance

### Traditional server-based architecture (EC2)

Virtual machines with custom application deployment and scaling

* Good, because maximum control over runtime environment and performance
* Good, because no execution time limits or architectural constraints
* Good, because familiar deployment and debugging patterns
* Bad, because highest operational overhead with server management
* Bad, because manual scaling and capacity planning required
* Bad, because highest cost due to constant resource provisioning
* Bad, because longer development cycles due to infrastructure management

## Implementation Considerations

### Function Design Patterns
- **Single Responsibility**: Each Lambda function handles one specific task
- **Event-Driven**: Functions triggered by S3 events, scheduled events, or API calls
- **Stateless Design**: All state stored in Neptune, S3, or DynamoDB
- **Error Handling**: Dead letter queues and retry mechanisms

### Performance Optimization
- **Memory Allocation**: Right-sized memory based on performance testing
- **Cold Start Mitigation**: Provisioned concurrency for time-critical functions
- **Connection Pooling**: Reuse database connections across invocations
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple items per invocation when possible

### Security Implementation
- **IAM Roles**: Principle of least privilege for function permissions
- **VPC Configuration**: Network isolation for sensitive operations
- **Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption for all data
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager for credentials
