# Governance Framework

## Overview

This document establishes the governance framework for the Cloud Remediator Sage project, ensuring consistent decision-making, risk management, and compliance with security standards.

## Governance Structure

### Technical Steering Committee
- **Responsibility**: Strategic technical decisions and architecture oversight
- **Members**: Senior engineers and security architects
- **Meeting Frequency**: Bi-weekly
- **Decision Authority**: Major architectural changes, technology adoption

### Security Review Board
- **Responsibility**: Security design reviews and compliance validation
- **Members**: Security engineers and compliance specialists
- **Meeting Frequency**: Weekly
- **Decision Authority**: Security architecture, vulnerability response

### Change Advisory Board
- **Responsibility**: Production change approval and risk assessment
- **Members**: Operations, security, and business representatives
- **Meeting Frequency**: Daily (for urgent changes), Weekly (standard)
- **Decision Authority**: Production deployments, emergency changes

## Decision-Making Framework

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- All significant architectural decisions must be documented as ADRs
- ADRs require review by Technical Steering Committee
- ADRs must include risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Status tracking: Proposed → Under Review → Accepted/Rejected

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
|--------|-----|--------|------|----------|
| **Low Probability** | Accept | Monitor | Mitigate | Mitigate |
| **Medium Probability** | Monitor | Mitigate | Mitigate | Avoid |
| **High Probability** | Mitigate | Mitigate | Avoid | Avoid |

### Change Classification

#### Low Risk Changes
- Documentation updates
- Configuration parameter adjustments
- Non-production environment changes
- **Approval**: Automated via CI/CD
- **Review**: Post-deployment review

#### Medium Risk Changes
- Feature additions with backward compatibility
- Performance optimizations
- Security rule updates
- **Approval**: Technical lead approval
- **Review**: Security review for security-related changes

#### High Risk Changes
- Breaking API changes
- Database schema modifications
- Security architecture changes
- **Approval**: Technical Steering Committee
- **Review**: Security Review Board + Change Advisory Board

#### Critical Risk Changes
- Production infrastructure changes
- Security framework modifications
- Data handling procedure changes
- **Approval**: Full governance review process
- **Review**: All governance bodies + executive approval

## Compliance Framework

### Security Standards Adherence
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Comprehensive security controls
- **AWS Security Best Practices**: Cloud-specific security measures
- **OWASP Top 10**: Web application security standards
- **CIS Controls**: Critical security controls implementation

### Audit Requirements
- **Code Reviews**: All changes require security-focused review
- **Penetration Testing**: Quarterly third-party security assessments
- **Compliance Audits**: Annual compliance verification
- **Vulnerability Assessments**: Continuous automated scanning

### Documentation Standards
- **Security Procedures**: Documented and regularly updated
- **Incident Response**: Clear escalation and response procedures
- **Business Continuity**: Disaster recovery and backup procedures
- **Training Materials**: Security awareness and technical training

## Risk Management

### Risk Categories
1. **Security Risks**: Data breaches, unauthorized access, vulnerabilities
2. **Operational Risks**: System failures, performance degradation
3. **Compliance Risks**: Regulatory violations, audit failures
4. **Technical Risks**: Technology obsolescence, technical debt

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Prevention**: Proactive security measures and testing
- **Detection**: Monitoring and alerting systems
- **Response**: Incident response and remediation procedures
- **Recovery**: Backup and disaster recovery capabilities

### Risk Monitoring
- **Continuous Assessment**: Automated risk scoring and reporting
- **Regular Reviews**: Monthly risk assessment meetings
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear escalation paths for high-risk issues
- **Metrics Tracking**: Key risk indicators and trending analysis

## Compliance Automation

### Automated Controls
- **Policy as Code**: Infrastructure and security policies automated
- **Continuous Compliance**: Real-time compliance monitoring
- **Automated Remediation**: Self-healing security configurations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging and audit capabilities

### Manual Controls
- **Design Reviews**: Human review of critical changes
- **Exception Handling**: Formal process for compliance exceptions
- **Training and Awareness**: Regular security training programs
- **Vendor Management**: Third-party security assessments

## Reporting and Metrics

### Governance Metrics
- Decision-making efficiency (time to approval)
- Risk mitigation effectiveness
- Compliance posture scoring
- Incident response times

### Security Metrics
- Vulnerability detection and remediation times
- Security control effectiveness
- Compliance audit results

## Continuous Improvement

### Review Processes
- **Quarterly Governance Review**: Assess framework effectiveness
- **Annual Policy Review**: Update policies and procedures  
- **Post-Incident Reviews**: Learn from security incidents
- **Best Practice Updates**: Incorporate industry developments

### Training and Development
- **Ongoing Security Training**: Regular updates on threats and controls
- **Governance Training**: Framework understanding and implementation
- **Technical Training**: Keep pace with technology evolution
- **Compliance Training**: Regulatory requirement updates

This governance framework ensures the Cloud Remediator Sage maintains the highest standards of security, compliance, and operational excellence while enabling rapid innovation and deployment.
