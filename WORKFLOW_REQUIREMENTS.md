# GitHub Actions Workflow Requirements

## Overview

This document specifies the required GitHub Actions workflows for comprehensive SDLC automation.

## Required Workflows

### 1. Continuous Integration (`ci.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests
**Requirements**:
- Node.js 18.x setup
- Dependency installation and caching
- Unit, integration, and contract tests
- Security scanning with ESLint security rules
- Code coverage reporting (>90% threshold)

### 2. Security Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)
**Triggers**: Schedule (daily), Manual dispatch
**Requirements**:
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SAST with CodeQL
- Container image scanning
- License compliance checking
- Security report generation

### 3. Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)
**Triggers**: Push to main branch
**Requirements**:
- Environment-specific deployments (dev, staging, prod)
- Infrastructure validation
- Automated testing in staging
- Manual approval for production
- Rollback capability

### 4. Release Management (`release.yml`)
**Triggers**: Release tag creation
**Requirements**:
- Semantic versioning
- Changelog generation
- SBOM creation
- Artifact signing
- GitHub release creation

## Workflow Standards

### Security Requirements
- All workflows must use pinned action versions
- Secrets must be stored in GitHub Secrets
- OIDC authentication preferred over long-lived credentials
- Audit logging enabled for all deployments

### Performance Requirements
- Build time < 10 minutes
- Test execution < 5 minutes
- Parallel job execution where possible
- Efficient caching strategies

## Implementation Priority
1. **High**: CI workflow with basic testing
2. **High**: Security scanning workflow
3. **Medium**: Deployment pipeline
4. **Low**: Release management automation
