### Threat Model

#### Assets
- Security findings and remediation data
- AWS credentials and access tokens
- System configuration and secrets
- Application source code and infrastructure

#### Threats
- **External Attackers**: Unauthorized access to systems and data

## Security Controls

### Authentication and Authorization

#### AWS IAM Configuration
```yaml
# Least privilege IAM role for Lambda functions
LambdaExecutionRole:
  Type: AWS::IAM::Role
  Properties:
    AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
      Version: '2012-10-17'
      Statement:
        - Effect: Allow
          Principal:
            Service: lambda.amazonaws.com
          Action: sts:AssumeRole
    ManagedPolicyArns:
      - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole
    Policies:
      - PolicyName: NeptuneAccess
        PolicyDocument:
          Version: '2012-10-17'
          Statement:
            - Effect: Allow
              Action:
                - neptune-db:connect
              Resource: !Sub 'arn:aws:neptune-db:${AWS::Region}:${AWS::AccountId}:*/*'
```

#### API Security
- Bearer token authentication for API endpoints
- Request signing for internal service communication
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS policies for web access

### Data Protection

#### Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all stored data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all network communications
- **Key Management**: AWS KMS with automatic key rotation

#### Data Classification
- **Public**: Documentation and open-source code
- **Internal**: Configuration and operational data
- **Confidential**: Security findings and remediation data
- **Restricted**: Credentials and access tokens

#### Data Handling
```javascript
// Example of secure data handling
const crypto = require('crypto');

class SecureDataHandler {
    constructor() {
        this.algorithm = 'aes-256-gcm';
        this.keyLength = 32;
    }

    encrypt(plaintext, key) {
        const iv = crypto.randomBytes(16);
        const cipher = crypto.createCipher(this.algorithm, key, iv);
        
        let encrypted = cipher.update(plaintext, 'utf8', 'hex');
        encrypted += cipher.final('hex');
        
        const authTag = cipher.getAuthTag();
        
        return {
            encrypted,
            iv: iv.toString('hex'),
            authTag: authTag.toString('hex')
        };
    }

    decrypt(encryptedData, key) {
        const decipher = crypto.createDecipher(
            this.algorithm, 
            key, 
            Buffer.from(encryptedData.iv, 'hex')
        );
        
        decipher.setAuthTag(Buffer.from(encryptedData.authTag, 'hex'));
        
        let decrypted = decipher.update(encryptedData.encrypted, 'hex', 'utf8');
        decrypted += decipher.final('utf8');
        
        return decrypted;
    }
}
```

### Input Validation

#### Security Finding Validation
```javascript
const Joi = require('joi');

const securityFindingSchema = Joi.object({
    id: Joi.string().uuid().required(),
    severity: Joi.string().valid('low', 'medium', 'high', 'critical').required(),
    title: Joi.string().max(200).required(),
    description: Joi.string().max(1000).required(),
    resource: Joi.object({
        type: Joi.string().required(),
        id: Joi.string().required(),
        region: Joi.string().required()
    }).required(),
    compliance: Joi.array().items(Joi.string()),
    remediation: Joi.object({
        type: Joi.string().required(),
        script: Joi.string().required()
    })
});

function validateSecurityFinding(data) {
    const { error, value } = securityFindingSchema.validate(data);
    if (error) {
        throw new Error(`Invalid security finding: ${error.message}`);
    }
    return value;
}
```

### Logging and Monitoring

#### Security Event Logging
```javascript
const { logger } = require('./src/monitoring/logger');

class SecurityLogger {
    static logSecurityEvent(event, severity, details, correlationId) {
        logger.security(event, correlationId, {
            severity,
            details,
            timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
            source: 'cloud-remediator-sage'
        });
    }

    static logAccessAttempt(userId, resource, success, correlationId) {
        this.logSecurityEvent(
            'access_attempt',
            success ? 'info' : 'warning',
            { userId, resource, success },
            correlationId
        );
    }

    static logDataAccess(userId, dataType, action, correlationId) {
        this.logSecurityEvent(
            'data_access',
            'info',
            { userId, dataType, action },
            correlationId
        );
    }
}
```
