A serverless framework to automate cloud security posture management (CSPM). It ingests security findings from scanners, prioritizes risks using a graph database, and auto-generates Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for remediation.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Multi-Cloud/SaaS Coverage**: Ingests findings from:
    *   **Prowler**: AWS, Azure, GCP, Kubernetes, Microsoft 365
    *   **CloudSploit**: OCI
    *   **Steampipe**: Microsoft 365
*   **Risk Graph Triage**: Utilizes Amazon Neptune to deduplicate findings and score risks.
*   **Automated Fix Generation**: Employs Jinja templates to create ready-to-use Terraform or Boto3 remediation scripts.
*   **Safe Mode**: Requires manual approval for remediation actions in production environments.
*   **ü§ñ Autonomous Backlog Management**: WSJF-prioritized autonomous execution with TDD and security integration. [Learn more](AUTONOMOUS_BACKLOG.md)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Risk Scoring Formula

`RiskScore = (CVSS_Weight * Asset_Exposure_Score) + Blast_Radius_Impact`

### Permissions for Amazon Neptune

Autonomous agents must use IAM database authentication with Gremlin. Ensure the execution role has a policy allowing `neptune-db:connect` via SigV4. See the [AWS documentation on connecting to Neptune with Gremlin and SigV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune/latest/userguide/iam-auth-connecting-gremlin-console.html) for a detailed guide.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

1.  Clone the repository and `cd` into the directory.
2.  Configure `serverless.yml` with your AWS credentials and Neptune endpoint.
3.  Deploy the framework: `serverless deploy`.

## üìà Roadmap

*   **v0.1.0**: Integration with Prowler; initial Terraform templates for AWS.
*   **v0.2.0**: Connectors for CloudSploit and Steampipe; Azure/GCP remediation packs.
*   **v0.3.0**: Enhanced risk triage logic.
