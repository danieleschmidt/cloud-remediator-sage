# Cloud Remediator Sage - Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Cloud Remediator Sage  
**Project Sponsor:** Terragon Labs  
**Project Manager/Lead:** Development Team  
**Charter Date:** 2025-08-02  
**Charter Version:** 1.0  

## Executive Summary

Cloud Remediator Sage is an open-source serverless framework designed to automate cloud security posture management (CSPM) across multi-cloud environments. The project addresses the critical gap in automated security remediation by providing intelligent risk prioritization, automated Infrastructure-as-Code generation, and seamless integration with existing security scanning tools.

## Problem Statement

### Business Challenge
Organizations struggle with:
- **Manual Security Remediation**: Security teams spend 70%+ of their time on manual, repetitive security fixes
- **Risk Prioritization Complexity**: Difficulty determining which security findings pose the greatest business risk
- **Multi-Cloud Security Gaps**: Inconsistent security posture across AWS, Azure, GCP, and other cloud providers
- **Compliance Overhead**: Manual effort required to maintain compliance with multiple regulatory frameworks
- **Alert Fatigue**: Security teams overwhelmed by thousands of security findings with unclear prioritization

### Market Opportunity
- Cloud security market projected to reach $68.6B by 2025
- 95% of organizations use multiple cloud providers (Flexera 2024 State of Cloud Report)
- Average organization uses 110+ SaaS applications requiring security monitoring
- 60% reduction in security incident response time through automation (Gartner 2024)

## Project Scope
