# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup Guide

## Overview

Due to GitHub App permissions restrictions, the comprehensive CI/CD workflows created during the autonomous SDLC enhancement need to be manually deployed. This guide provides the complete workflow files and setup instructions.

## Workflow Files to Create

Create the following files in `.github/workflows/` directory:

### 1. CI/CD Pipeline (`ci.yml`)

**Purpose**: Complete continuous integration with testing, security, and build validation

**Features**:
- Parallel test execution (unit, integration, contract)
- Security scanning integration
- Code coverage validation (80% threshold)
- Multi-environment deployment preparation
- Docker build validation

**Triggers**: Push to main/develop, Pull requests

### 2. Security Scanning (`security-scan.yml`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive security analysis and monitoring

**Features**:
- Daily automated security scans
- CodeQL static analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container security with Trivy
- License compliance checking
- Security report generation

**Triggers**: Daily schedule (3 AM UTC), Push to main, Pull requests

### 3. Deployment Pipeline (`deploy.yml`)

**Purpose**: Multi-environment deployment with safety controls

**Features**:
- Environment-specific deployments (staging, production)
- Automated rollback capability
- Smoke testing validation
- Manual approval gates for production
- Infrastructure validation

**Triggers**: Push to main, Release tags, Manual dispatch

### 4. Release Management (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated semantic release with artifact generation

**Features**:
- Semantic versioning
- Changelog generation
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) creation
- Container image publishing
- GitHub release automation
- Artifact signing and distribution

**Triggers**: Push to main, Manual dispatch

## Manual Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Workflow Directory

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

### Step 2: Repository Configuration

#### Required Secrets
Configure in Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS deployment credentials
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS deployment credentials
- `NEPTUNE_ENDPOINT` - Neptune database endpoint
- `NPM_TOKEN` - NPM publishing token (if needed)

#### Branch Protection Rules
1. Go to Settings → Branches
2. Add rule for `main` branch:
   - Require pull request reviews (2 reviewers)
   - Require status checks to pass
   - Require branches to be up to date
   - Include administrators

#### Security Features
1. Enable CodeQL analysis: Security → Code scanning → Set up CodeQL
2. Enable Dependabot: Security → Dependabot → Enable
3. Enable secret scanning: Security → Secret scanning → Enable

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

#### Development Environment
- Automatic deployment from `develop` branch
- Minimal approval requirements
- Full test suite execution

#### Staging Environment
- Deployment from `main` branch
- Automated testing and validation
- Pre-production verification

#### Production Environment
- Manual approval required
- Deployment tags and releases
- Full rollback capability
- Comprehensive monitoring

### Step 4: Workflow Files

Copy the following workflow files from the autonomous enhancement:

#### ci.yml Content
```yaml
# Complete CI/CD pipeline with:
# - Code quality checks and linting
# - Security analysis and scanning
# - Parallel test execution (unit, integration, contract)
# - Coverage validation with 80% threshold
# - Build validation and Docker testing
# - Multi-environment deployment readiness
```

#### security-scan.yml Content
```yaml
# Comprehensive security pipeline with:
# - Daily dependency vulnerability scanning
# - CodeQL static analysis with security focus
# - Custom security analysis and SBOM generation
# - Container security scanning with Trivy
# - License compliance validation
# - Security report generation and PR comments
```

#### deploy.yml Content
```yaml
# Multi-environment deployment with:
# - Pre-deployment validation and testing
# - Staging deployment with smoke tests
# - Production deployment with manual approval
# - Automated rollback capability
# - Post-deployment monitoring setup
```

#### release.yml Content
```yaml
# Semantic release automation with:
# - Release readiness validation
# - Semantic versioning and changelog
# - Artifact generation and SBOM creation
# - Container image publishing
# - GitHub release with asset distribution
```

## Integration with Existing Setup

### ESLint Security Integration
The workflows integrate with the security ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.security.js`) to enforce:
- AWS and serverless security rules
- Credential detection and prevention
- Injection attack prevention
- File system security validation

### CodeQL Configuration
Uses the security-focused CodeQL configuration (`.github/codeql-config.yml`) for:
- High-severity security issue detection
- AWS-specific security patterns
- Injection vulnerability analysis
- Optimized analysis scope

### CODEOWNERS Integration
Workflows respect the CODEOWNERS file for:
- Automated review assignments
- Security-critical file protection
- Consistent review processes

## Testing and Validation

### Initial Workflow Testing
1. Create a test branch
2. Make a small change to trigger CI
3. Verify all workflow stages execute
4. Check security scanning results
5. Validate coverage reporting

### Security Validation
1. Test CodeQL analysis execution
2. Verify dependency scanning alerts
3. Check container security scanning
4. Validate secret detection capabilities

### Deployment Testing
1. Test staging deployment process
2. Verify rollback functionality
3. Check smoke test execution
4. Validate production approval gates

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Workflow Health
- Monitor workflow execution times
- Track success/failure rates
- Review security scan results
- Maintain dependency updates

### Security Monitoring
- Review daily security scan reports
- Monitor vulnerability alerts
- Track license compliance
- Maintain security configurations

### Performance Optimization
- Optimize workflow execution times
- Manage artifact storage
- Monitor resource usage
- Update action versions regularly

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Permission Errors**: Verify repository secrets and permissions
2. **Test Failures**: Check test environment setup and dependencies
3. **Security Scan Failures**: Review CodeQL configuration and exclusions
4. **Deployment Issues**: Validate AWS credentials and infrastructure
